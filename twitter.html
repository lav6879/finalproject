				Twitter employs a multi-layered approach to content moderation which include: automated systems and human moderators. Twitter uses algorithms to automatically detect potentially "violating" content. This systems can flag tweets or accounts based on keywords, images, or other criteria. Twitter users can report tweets or accounts for potential policy violations, these reports are reviewed by human moderators who assess the content. Twitter has the power to remove content, issuing warnings to the account owner, or suspend or permanently ban the account.It also provides users with the opportunity to appeal moderation decisions if they believe their content was unfairly removed or their account was wrongly suspended. Twitter, under Elon Musk's leadership, complied with nearly all government requests to remove content, according to Twitter's own data, fully or partially complying with 98.8% of takedown requests since Musk's takeover on October 27.
