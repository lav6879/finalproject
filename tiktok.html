			<h2>How TikTok is Dangerous</h2>
			<p1>TikTokâ€™s design, immersing users in a continuous flow of snappy content, aims to captivate attention fully. However, this architecture inadvertently fosters an environment where fear is amplified, and misinformation thrives, especially in times of heightened anxiety. Additionally, TikTok's track record of swiftly removing users can empower malicious flaggers to launch targeted attacks, taking advantage of moderation processes that prioritize speed over context. With moderators often facing time constraints and limited compensation, they are pressured to make conservative decisions, leaving little room for nuanced judgment. As a result, online abusers exploit these shortcomings, utilizing flagging tactics to achieve their objectives. TikTok's rapid-paced nature can influence perceptions of unfolding conflicts, as emotive videos may overshadow considerations of legitimacy.</p1>
