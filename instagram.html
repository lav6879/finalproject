            <h2>Limiting Political Content</h2>
            <p1>Instagram has implemented a "limit political content" setting for all users. This setting restricts political content from accounts that users aren't following, ensuring that such content won't be recommended on Instagram reels, the explore page, in-feed recommendations, or suggested accounts. The policy has since drawn criticism from users, who have expressed concerns about this policy limiting users’ access to political content during a year with pivotal elections in the United States and around the world. A 51-page report titled, "Meta’s Broken Promises: Systemic Censorship of Palestine Content on Instagram and Facebook," highlights a consistent pattern of unjust removal and suppression of peaceful expressions supporting Palestine and public debates on Palestinian human rights. Social media is an essential platform for people to bear witness and speak out against abuses.</p1>

            <h2> Shadow Banning?</h2>
            <p>Instagram holds the authority to lower the visibility of posts or accounts on its platform, potentially rendering your content or account undiscoverable, hidden, or restricted. In certain instances, the content may even be completely removed. By opening the door to censoring political speech, Meta is preventing entire movements and organizations from growing and amassing support.</p>

        <div class="box content3">
            <h2>Past examples:</h2>
            <li>Meta blocked, slowed down, and suspended individuals whose posts about COVID-19 diverged from the talking points provided by their respective governments.</li>
            <li>In 2020, Instagram’s shadowbanned Black voices silencing them on the platform. A sudden surge of activity was witnessed in June 2020 when users shared information about #BlackLivesMatter using a hashtag so it got shadowbanned.</li>
            <li> In 2018 the list of shadowbanned hashtags contained many LGBTQ+ identities like #gays, #iamgay, #bi, #lesbiansofinstagram, #lesbian.</li>
